Good morning students! Today, we will be discussing digital electronics and specifically focusing on combinational and sequential circuits.

Digital electronics deals with circuits that operate using digital signals, which can have only two possible values: 0 or 1. These circuits can be either combinational or sequential.

Combinational circuits produce an output solely based on the current inputs. In these circuits, the output is determined by the present input values only and not influenced by past inputs. On the other hand, sequential circuits use both the present inputs and the past inputs to generate an output.

To design a digital circuit, we follow these steps:
1. State the problem.
2. Determine the number of available input and output variables.
3. Assign letter symbols to the input and output variables.
4. Define the truth table that shows the relationship between inputs and outputs.
5. Obtain the simplified Boolean function for each output.
6. Draw the logic diagram.

The most basic operation in digital circuits is addition. An adder circuit takes in two binary digits and produces the sum. There are two types of adder circuits: the half-adder and the full-adder.

A half-adder adds two bits together without considering any carry. It produces two outputs: the sum bit and the carry bit. A full-adder, on the other hand, takes in two bits and a carry from the previous column, and produces a sum bit and a carry-out bit.

We can implement the full-adder circuit using logic gates such as AND and XOR gates. The full-adder adds the two input bits and the carry-in bit to produce the sum bit and the carry-out bit.

A half-subtractor is a circuit that subtracts one bit from another and produces the difference. It also indicates if a borrow has occurred. This circuit is used when subtracting the least significant bit from the minuend.

Similar to the full-adder, a full-subtractor subtracts one bit from another with an additional borrow input from the previous column. It also produces a difference bit and a borrow bit for the next column.

To perform addition of binary numbers, we use an n-bit parallel adder, which is a circuit that adds two binary numbers in parallel form. It consists of multiple full-adders connected in a chain. The output carry of each full-adder is connected to the input carry of the next full-adder.

In the addition process, the carry propagates from one stage to the next. The carry propagation delay is the time between the application of the carry-in and the occurrence of the carry-out.

Subtraction can be done by taking the 2's complement of the subtrahend and adding it to the minuend. The result is obtained after the propagation of carries through multiple full-adders.

To speed up the addition process and eliminate carry propagation delays, we use a look-ahead-carry adder. This type of adder examines all the input bits simultaneously and generates the carry-in bits for all the stages together.

A decoder is a logic circuit that converts an N-bit binary input code into M output lines. It activates only one output line for each possible combination of inputs.

Another important circuit is the multiplexer, also known as a data selector. It accepts multiple data inputs and selects only one of them to pass through to the output based on the select lines.

A magnitude comparator is a circuit that compares two quantities and indicates whether they are equal or not. It produces an output signal based on the magnitude of the input quantities.

In summary, we discussed digital electronics and its two types: combinational and sequential circuits. We focused on adder and subtractor circuits, parallel adders, decoders, multiplexers, and magnitude comparators. These circuits play a crucial role in digital systems and computer architecture.
